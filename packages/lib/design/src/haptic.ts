/**
 * Haptic effect tokens. Plain JS constants — these aren't CSS, so they
 * don't live under `tokens/` with the Vanilla Extract files.
 *
 * The vocabulary mirrors the Microsoft Edge Web Haptics explainer
 * (`hint`, `tick`, `edge`, `align`), which deliberately leaves
 * waveform values unspecified — the user agent translates each effect
 * to a native API (iOS UIImpactFeedbackGenerator, Android
 * HapticFeedbackConstants, etc):
 * https://microsoftedge.github.io/MSEdgeExplainers/Haptics/explainer.html
 *
 * The web has no such bridge, so the patterns below are derived from
 * the Android side of the explainer's mapping table — that's the only
 * platform whose source we can read end-to-end. The chain:
 *
 *   1. The explainer maps each effect to a `HapticFeedbackConstants` ID.
 *   2. AOSP's `HapticFeedbackVibrationProvider#getVibrationForHapticFeedback`
 *      resolves that ID to a `VibrationEffect` (primitive or predefined).
 *   3. AOSP's default `VibrationConfig` resolves predefined effects to
 *      duration-only fallback patterns from `core/res/res/values/config.xml`.
 *
 * Sources (`platform_frameworks_base`, branch `main`):
 * - services/core/java/com/android/server/vibrator/HapticFeedbackVibrationProvider.java
 * - services/core/java/com/android/server/vibrator/VibrationSettings.java
 * - core/res/res/values/config.xml
 *
 * When a real Web Haptics API ships, swap call sites to
 * `navigator.playHaptics(name, intensity)` and treat these constants
 * as semantic labels only.
